Summary :
This project is part of the “MA5161 Advanced Financial Mathematics” course at Mathematics ITB. In this project, I implemented Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Monte Carlo Simulation method to simulate stock price paths.

Duration : October 2024 (1 Week)

Tasks :
•	Determined stock returns
•	Tested normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
•	Created a normal P-Plot
•	Determined drift and volatility
•	Simulated stock price paths using GBM and Monte Carlo method

Results :
Successfully determined stock returns, drift, volatility, and simulated stock price paths using GBM and Monte Carlo method.

Skills Developed :
•	Python
•	Stock Analysis
